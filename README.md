## U-Net Semantic Segmentation Model
This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net model for semantic segmentation. 
U-Net is a deep learning architecture designed for precise image segmentation tasks, and it is widely used in medical image analysis and other image processing applications.

## Overview
The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for semantic segmentation.
It consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, which helps the model capture both high-level and low-level features. 
This implementation is based on the original U-Net architecture and is intended for educational purposes.

## Features
U-Net Architecture: Encoder-decoder network with skip connections.
Customizable Input Size: Adaptable to various input image sizes.
